## Important Notes

### Shielded pool removal
- PR [#628](https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/zen/pull/628) implements [ZenIP-42207](https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/ZenIPs/blob/master/zenip-42207.md), which introduces a hard fork fully disabling the shielded pool from `zend`. After the hard fork, it will no longer be possible to submit and process transactions involving shielded (z-) addresses, thus transparent-to-shielded, shielded-to-shielded and shielded-to-transparent transactions will be completely disallowed.
- PR [#628](https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/zen/pull/628) as a consequence of [ZenIP-42207](https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/ZenIPs/blob/master/zenip-42207.md), the following RPC commands
    - `z_sendmany`
    - `z_mergetoaddress`

    have been partially disabled, as after the hard fork they are only allowed to submit transparent-to-transparent transactions (check inline documentation for additional details).

## New Features and Improvements

## Bugfixes

## Minor Changes
- PR [#628](https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/zen/pull/628) all the RPC commands interacting with the shielded pool - hence, all the RPC commands starting with `z_` or `zc_` (for instance `z_getbalanace` or `zc_raw_joinsplit`) - are now *deprecated*. A warning message has been included in the help body of these commands.
